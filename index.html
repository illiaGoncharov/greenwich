                    Established in 2021, Greenwich Cultural Services was born from a desire to bring art and artists to a wider audience.  We believe that culture is paramount to civilisation and that visual art is one of the most important modes of expression available to us. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our mission is to support living artists as a way of preserving cultural capital for future generations. We forge relationships between companies and contemporary artists to create brand awareness and credibility, while ensuring ongoing support for the visual arts and opening new spaces for creative partnerships. 
                    GCS was created by Rita Almeida Freitas and Marisa Bellani, two contemporary art professionals who saw the need to respond to social and environmental issues through art. With this objective at the core of the company, we commit to proposing a diverse range of sustainable solutions and to working with companies with the same goals. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our founders Rita and Marisa are professionals from the art industry with 20 years of combined experience. 
                    Highly knowledgeable in contemporary art and well equipped to navigate the market,  we provide easy access to a global network of artists, galleries and curators.
